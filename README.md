# How to speed up prerendering with `sharedPrerenderData`

We check out Nuxt's new feature `sharedPrerenderData` which was introduced in Nuxt 3.10. It allows us to share data between pages during prerendering. That can be useful to speed up the prerendering process and reduce the amount of duplicate requests.
